      <h1>A Few Sentences About Myself.</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Rohit Pemmasani.</p>
      <p>This is my first website!</p>
      <p>I am a sophomore Computer Science student, I am also doing a minor in pre-health.</p>
      <p>Although this choice of major and minor may seem odd, being a CS student helps set me apart in the pool of medical school applicants.</p>
      <p>My hobbies include watching movies, programming, and hanging out with friends.</p>
      <p>One of my favourite movies is Lawrence of Arabia.</p>
      <p>This is my first class using HTML, although I have some previous experience.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
